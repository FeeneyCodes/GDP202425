Dire warning about me posting these old exams. 

They are being placed here as a *courtesy* so you can see the kind of format you'll see, and what's expected.

These are *NOT* "comprehensive reviews" in any sense:

What's on these isn't necessarily what you saw in your class:
* They are good preparation, I suppose
* I will not be giving out "solutions"
* There will be things on older exams that you havenâ€™t seen, saw in a different order, etc.

In other words, whatever you may or may not see on these old exams has ABSOLUTELY NO BEARING on what you may or may not see on YOUR exam. 

Here's a thought:

What if you were in a class, and someone said "Hey, did you know Sally has copies Feeney's old mid-terms?", what would you do then? I bet you would track down Sally and ask/beg her to give you copies, right? 

Well, now you don't have to find this hypothetical "person with the exams", as I've already uploaded them! Hazzah!

They are nominally three (3) hours in length, in the sense that if I was booking a physical room, it would be for three (3) hours, likely no internet, including the time it would take for you to compress and upload your exam. 

(Maybe practice doing this with one of the old exams? Give yourself three hours and see how it goes?)
