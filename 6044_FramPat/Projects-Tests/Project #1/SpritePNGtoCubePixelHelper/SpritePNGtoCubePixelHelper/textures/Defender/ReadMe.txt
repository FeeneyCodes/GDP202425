I took the original defendersprites.jpg file and saved it as a PNG
Then I noticed that the 'pixels' were actually 4x4 pixels in size
and not a single colour.
So I saved the image as a 16 colour BMP file.
You can see in that file that the pixels are not uniform.
I also cropped the image so that the upper-left part is right at the edge of the image.
